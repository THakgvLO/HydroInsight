## 🎯 Project Overview

**HydroNexus Africa** is an interdisciplinary water quality monitoring system that combines **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, **Environmental Sciences**, and **Computer Science** to address critical water quality challenges in South Africa.

### 🌍 **Environmental Context: South Africa's Water Crisis**

South Africa faces significant water quality challenges due to industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, urban wastewater issues, and climate change impacts. This project provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring, analyzing, and managing water quality data across multiple monitoring stations.
